An extremely simple example of how to use the CNI API provided by GCJ.
Uses code from <https://gcc.gnu.org/java/cni-2.txt>, as referenced in [the GCC Java FAQ](https://gcc.gnu.org/java/faq.html#6_1).

As the original example does not provide a license, and I already modified it (albeit minimal), consider it public domain.
